It increased slightly in 2013 and returned to growth in 2014. This fluctuation suggests that marketing strategies may not be effective, or company has cut its marketing budget in 2011 and 2012. Or consumer demand may have changed, and the company has not adapted in time.

•	Profit: Total earnings after all expenses (12.08M in 2010). Shows the overall financial gain. Like revenue, there is a shard decline in profit in the next 3 years. From 2011 – 2013, the company may have faced increased production costs, marketing cost, personnel cost,… In 2014, the profit increased, company may have introduced new products or expanded into new markets, which increased revenue and profit

Analytical Significance:

The New Rate in 2012 was very high (99.08%), but dropped to 60.67% in 2014

•	In 2012: The number of new customers accounted for almost all customers (3,000/3,030 ≈ 99.08%). This shows that the business mainly attracted new customers, with very few returning for a second purchase

•	In 2014: The proportion of new customers sharply decreased to 60.67% (506/834 ≈ 60.67%). This means the business had more returning customers and was no longer overly dependent on acquiring new ones.

The Return Rate in 2012 was very low (0.92%), but increased significantly to 39.33% in 2014

•	In 2012: The return rate was extremely low (30/3,030 ≈ 0.92%). This indicates that customers were not coming back, possibly because the product/service was not attractive enough or there were no effective customer care programs.

•	In 2014: The return rate rose sharply to 39.33% (328/834 ≈ 39.33%). This shows that the business improved the customer experience and increased the ability to retain existing customers

Reasons:

•	In 2012: The business focused on attracting new customers and did not yet have a strategy for retaining existing ones, or customers did not have a reason to return

•	In 2014: The business improved its services, products, or implemented customer care programs, promotions, and after-sales support, which helped increase the return rate. This reduced dependence on new customers and built a loyal customer base

Retention Cohort:

2012-11, 2012-12, and 2013-01 show the best retention:

•	Retained more than 20% of users up to months 11–12.

•	Likely due to effective product updates, successful campaigns, or user experience improvements.

Major drop-off occurs within the first 1–3 months:

•	2013-04: Starts at 100%, drops to ~3.30% by month 3 (~97% churn rate).

•	This indicates issues with onboarding or early user experience
